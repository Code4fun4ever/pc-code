summary: >
  You receive $n$ integers. Determine if it's possible to form an undirected
  graph with no more than one edge between two nodes, such that the $n$
  integers represent the degree of each node.
comments: >
  There are mathematical tools to help with this problem, such as the
  Erd√∂s-Gallai theorem.  It would seem that either the test data is weak, or
  the specification of the input is wrong, because it has been reported that
  algorithms with complexities of at least $O(n^2)$ get AC. Be careful
  because there is no guarantee that the integers representing the degrees
  are positive.
