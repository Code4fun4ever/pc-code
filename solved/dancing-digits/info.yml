summary: >
    Consider a permutation of the first 8 positive integers. These integers
    also receive a property of "gender", where a number left positive is
    "male", but if turned into a negative number is "female". A permutation
    can be transformed into another in one step by swapping two numbers,
    such that a "dancing pair" is formed involving any of the swapped
    numbers. A dancing pair is a pair of adjacent numbers of different
    gender, such that their sum is a prime number (the sum doesn't take into
    account the sign). Given an arbitrary permutation, determine the minimum
    number of steps required to transform it into a sorted permutation
    (again, ignoring the gender).
