summary: >
  A strictly increasing sequence of $n$ integers is given, representing $n$
  steps that need to be taken. Each step requires a certain "strength" value
  $k$. If a step has a distance of exactly $k$, then the strength value is
  decreased by 1, but if the distance is less than $k$, then $k$ doesn't
  change. Knowing the sequence of distances, find the minimum $k$ to be able
  to take all the steps.
