summary: >
  Report the number of swaps between adjacent element necessary to sort a
  list of up to 1000 numbers.
comments: >
  An simpler (lower constraints) version of the classic problem also
  presented in UVa's problems 11495 and 10810. A $O(n^2)$ algorithm might
  work here. Note that in this problem the sequence can have repeated
  numbers.
