summary: >
  Given a weighted graph with $N$ vertices and $R$ edges, find the cost of
  the *second* best path between two vertices. The second best path has a
  cost strictly greater than the best path, but is the best among all
  remaining paths, and it can visit vertices or edges more than once.
