summary: >
  This problem has a convoluted mathematical description, but it can be
  thought of as the following equivalent problem: A matrix of zeroes and
  ones and size $3 \times 3$ is given. A transformation over a matrix turns
  every cell into the sum (modulo 2) of all its neighbours. Find the number
  of transformations required to turn the original matrix into a matrix
  entirely made up of zeroes.
comments: >
  Notice that the number of possible matrices is relatively small (2^9) so
  you can precalculate all answers. All configurations converge into a
  matrix of zeroes.
