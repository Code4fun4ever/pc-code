summary: >
  You're playing a game against a friend. There are $R$ red marbles and $B$
  blue marbles in a bag. You start, and at each turn you pick one marble at
  random, and after that your friend picks a blue marble, if possible. If
  the very last marble is blue, you win, otherwise, if there are no blue
  marbles left but still red marbles remaining in the bag, you lose. Given
  the values of $R$ and $B$, what is the probability of winning?

  This problem is borrowed from TopCoder's SRM 408. See the links.

  Think about a way to calculate the interesting values once, and then
  answer each test case in O(1).
