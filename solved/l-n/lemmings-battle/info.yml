summary: >
  Two armies fight against each other in a number of rounds. There are $B$
  battlefields, and at each round one fighter from each army fights on each
  battlefield. The fighter with the higher power wins and survives, while
  the loser dies, but the power of the winner is reduced by the value of the
  loser's power. If both fighters have the same power, both die.

  The fighters selected at each round are always the ones with the highest
  power from each army, until one army is completely depleted or both are
  empty at the same time. Who wins?
comments: >
  Choose the right data structure so obtaining the elements in order for
  each round is fast, without having to sort the whole list of elements
  continuously.
