  You get a loan from the bank to pay a car. You have to pay the loan in a
  certain number of months, you have to give a down payment, and then each
  month there is a certain depreciation, which is a percentage that is lost
  from the car's value each month, starting from month 0 (meaning the moment
  the car gets out of the lot). Find out the number of months that have to
  pass until you owe less than the car's value at that moment.

  With so much information going on it's easy to get confused. Make sure you
  understand the meaning of all the information you're given. The down
  payment is a fixed amont of money you pay only once (the moment you buy
  the car), and that value, plus the loan from the bank is the original
  value of the car. The monthly payments are equal to the value of the loan
  divided by the number of months of the loan.
