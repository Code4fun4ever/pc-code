summary: >
  A sequence of two-integer tuples is given. These tuples represent the
  height and width of a series of buildings. The length of a subsequence is
  defined as the sum of widths of a subsequence of buildings such that their
  heights are strictly increasing or decreasing. Determine the maximum
  lengths of increasing and decreasing subsequences.
comments: >
  Because the specification is very lacking, it's hard to know at first
  which type of strategy to use. An $O(n^2)$ algorithm is good enough.
