summary: >
  You get a list of segments with integer boundaries representing the
  periods of time in which a number of processes run. A wrapper is to be
  placed around each process, and wrappers con only be used for one process
  at a time. Once its process ends, the wrapper is released and it can be
  reused. Find the minimum number of wrappers required for all processes.
