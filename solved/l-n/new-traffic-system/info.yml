summary: >
  A group of cities are connected via one-way roads. You receive the
  description of two graphs over these cities: one of the current roads and
  their distances, and one of *planned* roads with their distances. You also
  receive a cap on the number of proposed roads you can build (maximum 10).
  Find the shortest path between two given cities, using proposed roads if
  necessary, as long as you don't use more than the limit.
