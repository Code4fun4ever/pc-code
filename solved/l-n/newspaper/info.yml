summary: >
  A table of characters and integer values is given. Then a number of lines
  of text is presented. Calculate the total value of the text, as per the
  table.
comments: >
  There is a big gotcha in this problem, and it's that the lines of text can
  have characters with ASCII values above 127, so you have to handle that
  correctly (using `unsigned char`, for example).

  Make sure that the number of cents after the decimal point has exactly two
  digits.
