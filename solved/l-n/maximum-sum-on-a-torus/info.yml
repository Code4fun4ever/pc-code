summary: >
    Given a square matrix of integers, find the maximum sum from a rectangle
    (with wrap-arounds) in the matrix.
comments: >
    A $O(n^3)$ solution is possible by using prefix sums on the columns or
    rows, and a simple variant of Kadane's algorithm. To deal with the
    wraparound, you could replicate the original matrix (size $N \times N$)
    into a matrix of size $2N \times 2N$).

    Notice that an empty rectangle is valid (with sum 0). See also problem
    UVa 108.
