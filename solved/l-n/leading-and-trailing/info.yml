summary: >
  Given two integers $n$ and $k$, find out the three most significant digits
  and the three least significant digits of $n^k$.
comments: >
  The last 3 digits can be obtained using a simple modular exponentiation
  routine. For the first 3 digits, use the same routine, and try to keep
  track of only the significant figures you need. It can be useful to use a
  small function to figure out the number of digits (to the left of the
  decimal point) of a number.

  A conclusive proof that this kind of approach (using floating point
  representations) always provide the right answer is not known, but all you
  need is to pass the test cases, which should not be very hard.
