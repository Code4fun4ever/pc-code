summary: >
  Each person in a group of $n$ people is identified by a number,
  representing their relative height (1 is the shortest person, $n$ is the
  tallest person). They form a line, and you receive a sequence of $n$
  numbers, where the $i$th number ($1 \leq i \leq n$) represents the amount
  of people taller than the $i$th person and to his/her left. Determine the
  identifier of the person first in line.
