summary: >
    A number of ice floes hold a number of penguins. The penguins want to
    gather in a single floe by jumping between the floes, but each floe
    breaks and disappears after a certain number of penguins jump off of it
    (arriving at a floe is okay). Given the location of all the floes, their
    resistance (number of jumps reach floe resists), and the maximum jumping
    distance for all penguins, determine the list of all ice floes where
    they could gather.
