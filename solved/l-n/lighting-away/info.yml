summary: >
  A set of lights are setup such that by turning on a certain light, a chain
  reaction can be produced because some lights are turned on automatically
  if they sense other nearby lights have been flipped on. Given a directed
  graph that describes the relations between the lights (an edge represents
  that when one light is turned on, the other is turned on automatically),
  find out the minimum number of lights that have to be turned on, so the
  entire set of lights end up on.
