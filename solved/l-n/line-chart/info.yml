summary: >
    For a list of integers, a $K$-peak line chart is defined as a plotting
    of a subset of the integers, such that the resulting chart has exactly
    $K$ peaks (points that strictly higher or lower than its two
    neighbours). Calculate the total number of distinct $K$-peak charts for
    a given ordered set.
