summary: >
    Given two strings, a "love calculation" is performed by adding the
    numeric value of all aphabetical letters in each string ('A' is 1, 'B'
    is 2, etc.), and then reducing these numbers if they have more than one
    digit, by adding up their digits until they become 1-digit numbers. Then
    the ratio between the two numbers, expressed as a percentage, is the
    result. Given two strings, calculate their love.
