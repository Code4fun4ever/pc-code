summary: >
    You receive a series of lines composed by sequences of characters that
    represent two surfaces (one on the left, one on the right). Each line is
    composed by one or more 'X', representing one row from the left surface,
    followed by zero or more spaces, followed by one or more 'X',
    representing one row from the right surface. All lines have the same fixed
    length.

    Calculate the total number of "space" blocks that are left when you get
    the left and right surfaces as close as possible, moving them
    horizontally.
