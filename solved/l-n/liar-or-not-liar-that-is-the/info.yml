summary: >
    Given a number $N$ or $N!$ (with $N \leq 10^7$), determine if it can be
    expressed as the sum of the squares of two integers. If it can't, and
    the input is a factorial, print a list of the first 50 primes that you
    need to divide $N!$ by to get them to be expressable as the wanted sum.
