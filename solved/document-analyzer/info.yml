summary: >
  You receive a large block of text. A word is a sequence of lowercase
  alphabetical letters. Assign a sequential integer number to each word in
  the text, and then identify two indices $p, q$ such that all the words
  from the text are included in the range from word $p$ to word $q$, and the
  range is as small as possible.
comments: >
  Be careful with the problem in the UVa judge. It seems that the judge's
  data does not follow the specification. Try assuming a little larger
  limits (160-character lines and $10^5 + 10$ words worked).
