summary: >
  A bar code is considered to be a sequence of "bars", each bar with a given
  width, of one of two colors (black or white) starting always with a bar of
  color black. Given the total length of a bar code ($n$), the total number
  of bars in the code ($k$) and the maximum width of any bar in that code
  ($m$), determine the number of valid bar codes that fit to the parameters
  $n, k, m$.
