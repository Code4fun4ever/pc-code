summary: >
    A year is leap if it's divisible by 4, but not if it's divisible by 100,
    unless it's divisible by 400, in which case it's leap. A year is also a
    "Huluculu festival" year if it's divisible by 15, and a "Bulukulu
    festival" if it's divisible by 55 *and* a leap year. Given a year (which
    could be *very* large), determine all the properties it has.
