summary: >
    The game of snakes and ladders is played on a board of 100 squares,
    which may include "snake" and "ladders", which take you from one square
    another; a snake takes you back to a previous square, and a ladder takes
    you forward. At each turn you use a fair 6-sided die to determine the
    numbre of posititons to move. Given the description of a board,
    determine the expected number of times you have to throw a die to
    complete the game.
