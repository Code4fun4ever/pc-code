summary: >
  You receive a list of integers, and from it you have to form an strictly
  increasing sequence. However, to do this, you can only select numbers from
  it (in order) and push them into either end of the sequence (front or
  back). It is possible to skip some numbers. Determine the maximum possible
  length of the resulting sequence.
comments: >
  Think about the implications of reversing the list of numbers, and then
  determining the length of the LIS and LDS that end on each position.
