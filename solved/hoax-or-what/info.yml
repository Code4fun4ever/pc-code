summary: >
  A store has a promotion that works like this: a bag with bills from the
  customers is kept during $n$ days. Every day new bills can be added to the
  bag, and at the end of the day the bills with the highest and lowest
  values are taken out of the bag, and their difference is given as a prize.
  Calculate the total of all the prizes given during the $n$ day period.

  Don't pay much attention to the big warning at the end of the problem
  statement. Make sure you use fast I/O methods, and try to optimise the use
  of your data structures, and you can comfortably use STL's set or
  multiset.
