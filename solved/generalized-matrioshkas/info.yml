summary: >
  You receive a sequence of integer numbers. Inside this sequence, a
  subsequence of consecutive elements $s_i, s_{i+1}, s_{i+2}, \dots, s_{j}$,
  where $s_i$ is a negative number, and $|s_i| = |s_j|$, represent a toy of
  size $s_j$ with nested toys described by $s_{i+1}, \dots, s_{j-1}$. The
  sum of sizes of all toys one level below a toy with size $K$ must be
  strictly less than $K$. Determine if the given sequence describe a valid
  arrangement of nested toys.
