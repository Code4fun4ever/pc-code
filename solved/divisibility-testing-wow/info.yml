    Consider the three types of divisibility tests for integer numbers:

    *   A number is divisible by $D$ in base $B$ if its rightmost $k$ digits
        are divisible by $D$.
    *   A number is divisible by $D$ in base $B$ if the sum of all its
        digits is divisible bt $D$.
    *   A number is divisible by $D$ in base $B$ if you add the first $k$
        rightmost digits with the negative of the next $k$ digits, and then
        plus the next $k$ digits, and so on, alternating the signs, and the
        total sum is divisible by $D$.

    Now, given a number $D$ and a base $B$, determine how many of these
    rules can be applied, and their parameters.
