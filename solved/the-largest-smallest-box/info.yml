    title: Largest Box

    summary: >
      From a rectangular card, squares of side $x$ are removed from its
      corners, to produce a 3D box without a lid. Given the width and length
      of the original card, find the maximum volume possible of the final
      box, for any value of $x$.

  minimum volume.

  Notice the UVa doesn't use a special judge for this problem, so it's more
  sensitive to precision errors. Add a small epsilon to the answers in that
  case.

  To find the maximum volume, a standard mathematical optimisation can give
  the answer. For the minimum volume, just think of how should the cuts be
  done to produce a volume of 0.0. The answer always has three numbers in
  UVa.
