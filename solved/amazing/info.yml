summary: >
  A robot is placed in a rectangular maze. The robot is programmed to always
  keep a wall at its right, and whenever it can't move forward, it turns
  left. It starts on the bottom left corner, looking east, and finishes its
  trip when it returns to that cell. Report the number of cells that are
  visited 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 times.
comments: >
  The maximum size of a maze is not specified (!), but you can make a guess
  using the fact that the output has to be printed in a field of width 3.
