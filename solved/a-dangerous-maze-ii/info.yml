summary: >
  You are inside a maze, in front of a series of doors. By choosing a door,
  you follow a path, taking a certain amount of time, and at its end you
  find yourself either out of the maze, or back at the beginning. If the
  probability for choosing any given path is the same for all doors, then
  what is the expected amount of time to get out if the maze?

  You also remember the last $K$ decisions you made, and if you have
  previously chosen a door that takes you back to the beginning, you wonâ€™t
  select it again, as long as it remains one of your last $K$ decisions.
