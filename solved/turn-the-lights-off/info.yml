summary: >
  A $10 \times 10$ grid of lights is setup. Every time you switch a light in
  any cell, the state of that cell and all its neighbours (horizontally and
  vertically) is switched. Given an arbitrary initial state of the grgid,
  Find the minimum number of "moves" required to turn all the lights off.

  This is a larger version of a game called "Lights Out". In that game, a
  known strategy that can be applied here is as follows: switch a random
  subset of lights from the top row, and then "chase the lights" to the
  bottom row. What this means is, starting from the second row and going
  doen, press a light only if the light to the north is on. Eventually
  you'll find a configuration that turns all the lights off and that is the
  answer. (It just so happens that a grid of size 10 guarantees that there
  exists a unique solution for every configuration, but this is not true in
  general for other sizes).
