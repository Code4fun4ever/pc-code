summary: >
  A square matrix of size $n^2$ is said to be parititioned correctly if
  it has $n$ partitions, where each partition is a group of $n$ contiguos
  cells (two cells are contiguous if they share a side).
  Given the description of the partitions in a square matrix, determine if
  it's a valid partitioning.
comments: >
  There is a lot of little details that are left unmentioned in the problem
  statement. Things like, will every line contain $2n$ numbers? Will the
  indices be valid? Will a certain coordinate appear at most once? Don't
  make assumptions and code defensively.
