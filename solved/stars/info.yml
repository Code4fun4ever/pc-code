    You place $N$ points on the circumference of a circle, dividing it into
    $N$ arcs of equal length. Then, for any $k$ in $1 \leq k < N$ you draw
    geometric figures by starting at any point, and drawing a straight line
    from it to the $k$th next point in either direction, and continuing
    until yu can't draw any new lines. One of these drawing is called
    "complete" if it uses all the $N$ points as vertices in the polygon
    generated.

    Given the value of $N$, determine the total number of complete figures
    that can be generated from it.
