summary: >
  You receive the description of a histogram; a series of heights of
  rectangles that are placed next to each other with a common base line, all
  of width 1. Determine the largest area of a rectangle that is completely
  inside the outline of the histogram.

  Think of a divide-and-conquer strategy. Let's say that you want to find
  the largest area in a region where the minimum height is $m$ and its
  position is $x$. Then there are in general three possibilities for finding
  the largest area in that region: $m$ times the width, or the largest for
  the region to the left of $x$, or the largest for the region to the right
  of $x$.
