summary: >
  The 15-Puzzle is a game constructed with 15 sliding tiles, numbered from 1
  to 15, arranged in a $4 \times 4$ frame. Since there are 16 squares and
  only 15 tiles, there is always an empty square, where one of the adjacent
  tiles can be slided into. The object of the game is to arrange the tiles
  so they are in order according to their numbers, and the last tile (the
  one in the bottom left) is the empty square.

  Given an arbitrary configuration of the puzzle, determine the shortest,
  lexicographically lowest sequence of moves necessary to solve it, or
  report if it's impossible (a puzzle is considered impossible if it can't
  be solved with at most 35 moves).
