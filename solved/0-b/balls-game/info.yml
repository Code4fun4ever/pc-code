summary: >
    A sequence of colored balls (identified by integers) is given such that
    no three consecutive balls have the same color. You have an additional
    ball, which can place anywhere inside the sequence. If after placing the
    ball a group of three or more balls of the same color is formed, all the
    balls in that group disappear, and this produce a chain reaction from
    the remainding balls. Determine the maximum number of balls that can
    disappear after placing the extra ball.
