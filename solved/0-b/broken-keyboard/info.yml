summary: >
  You receive a string of text that represents the input processed
  internally by a text editor. Two special characters denote the pressing of
  the "Home" and "End" keys, which move the cursor to the beginning and the
  end of the current line, respectively. Print the output that would produce
  the text editor after processing the input.
