  There is a number of objects that have to be picked, one by one, until all
  of them have been picked (once you pick one object, you return it to the
  pool of objects and have to pick again). However, the objects are of two
  kinds, one that you can recognise easily so objects of this type are never
  picked more than once, and the other is standard, so objects of this type
  could be picked more than once.

  Every object has a certain weight. Calculate the expected value of the
  total weight of the objects picked until all the objects have been picked.
