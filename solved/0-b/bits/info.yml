summary: >
  Given an integer $N$, find out the summation of the total number of times
  in which two 1's are adjacent in the binary representation of all natural
  numbers up to $N$.
comments: >
  UVa's version of this problem requires using big integers for the answer.
  LightOJ's version is saner. There also exists dynamic programming methods
  to solve this, bit I find the plain counting solution easier.
