summary: >
  A long wire of length $L$ is placed along the $X$ axis in a 3-D system of
  coordinates. At every point $(i, 0, 0)$ with $i$ integer going from $L -
  1$ to $1$, it may be bended $\pi/2$ in any direction parallel to the axes
  $Y$ or $Z$.  Given the series of bendings, determine the direction in
  which the tip of the wire is pointing to in the end.
