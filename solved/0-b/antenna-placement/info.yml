summary: >
    Given a rectangular grid, some of its cells have to be covered by $2
    \times 1$ blocks, that can be placed vertically or horizontally on the
    board, and they can even overlap. Find the minimum number of blocks
    required to cover all relevant cells.
comments: >
    If you think of the grid like a chess boards, the blocks will always
    cover two cells of different colors. From this, a natural way to
    partition the cells into two groups can be formulated.

    What meaning could you give to a connection between a cell in one group
    to a cell in the other group? What meaning would have the maximum
    matching between these two groups?
