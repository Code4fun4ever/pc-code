  A network consists of a number of nodes. A packet travelling in the
  network comes with a time-to-live (TTL) field which indicates the
  remaining number of nodes that it can visit before being dropped. Given a
  network, and a series of queries of the form (starting node, TTL),
  determine the number of nodes that are not reached by the packet.
