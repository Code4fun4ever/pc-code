summary: >
  You receive two sets of lines of text that have to be compared, and you
  have to answer with one of three messages:

  * *Accepted* if the two sets of text are equal
  * *Presentation Error* if the sets are not equal, but the numeric
    characters in both sets are the same (they could be separated by other
    characters, but they have to be in the same order).
  * *Wrong Answer* otherwise.
