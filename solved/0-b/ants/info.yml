summary: >
    A group of ants move with constant speed of one length unit per second
    on a 1D stick of length $l$, but it's unknown in which direction they
    are going initially. If two ants bump into each other, they both turn
    around and continue moving; if they reach one of the ends of the stick,
    they fall. Given the length of the stick and the location of all ants,
    determine the minimum time possible required for all ants to fall from
    the stick, and the maximum time possible.
