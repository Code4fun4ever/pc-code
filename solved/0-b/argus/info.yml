  A number of periodic queries are setup to be run simultaneously. Each
  query has a number that identifies it, and a period. Given the list of
  queries, and an integer $K$, print the IDs of the first $K$ queries that
  are executed. If two queries are to run at the same point in time, they
  are run in ascending order according to their IDs.
