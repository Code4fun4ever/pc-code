summary: >
  Given a list of 10 players, with their names and offensize/defensive
  stats, print a formation of 2 lines of 5 players (the attackers and
  defenders), such that the offensive score of the attacking line is
  maximized; if there's not a unique solution, then maximize the defending
  score of the rest of the players; if the tie remains then choose the
  offensive line from the list of attackers that comes lexicographically
  earliest.
