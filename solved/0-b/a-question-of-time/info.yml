summary: >
  An analog clock is said to have a symmetry line formed by the angle of
  the hour hand at some arbitrary point in time. Find all instances inside a
  range of time when the hour hand and the minute hand are symmetric; that
  is, they are on opposite sides of the symmetry line, and at the same
  distance from it.
