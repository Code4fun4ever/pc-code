summary: >
    A connected, undirected graph represents an underground system of
    junctions and tunnels made by ants. Some of these junctions will include
    an escape shaft (maximum one per junction), so that ants can escape to
    the surface in case of a disaster. Assuming that a disaster destroys at
    most one junction, determine the minimum number of escape shafts
    necessary, and the total number of ways in which those shafts can be
    built.
