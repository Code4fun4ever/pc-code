summary: >
  A number $n$ of people have to cross a bridge at night, using only one
  flashlight. A maximum of two people can cross the bridge at any time, and
  each person moves at a specified speed.  Devise a sequence of moves so
  they all cross the bridge in the minimum time possible.
comments: >
  Notice that, until you have two or less people waiting to cross the
  bridge, you have to send two people over, and one has to come back
  ---consider all that as one move. Now, it's not necessary to consider all
  possible pairs to find the best option. Just check the two fastest, the two
  slowest, and the fastest and slowest, and see which of those three pairs
  provide the best overall option. The one that returns can always be the
  fastest from the other side.
