summary: >
  A two player game has the following rules: there is a number of marbles
  and at each turn one player takes one or two marbles. Depending on the
  player who starts, the end condition is different. It could be that the
  player who takes the last marble wins, or that the player who makes the
  last move loses the game.

  Knowing the number of marbles, and the player who starts, determine the
  winner.

  Being an impartial game, the solution can be deduced by applying
  Sprague-Grundy theory, but this can also be solved by observing the
  behavoiur of the game and noticing a pattern.
