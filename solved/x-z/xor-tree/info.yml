summary: >
    The nodes in a tree are filled with zeroes or ones. An operation over
    this tree is defined as selecting a node, and then that node and all
    its descendants on even-numbered levels (counting from that node) are
    flipped. Given an initial tree and a goal tree, find the minimum number
    of operations required to transform the initial tree into the goal, and
    identify the nodes that have to be selected.
