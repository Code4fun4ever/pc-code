summary: >
  Given a series of values of coins and bills, and an amount of money you
  have to make, find the minimum number of coins you need to use to make at
  least the amount of money required. It may be impossible to match the
  amount exactly, but it's guaranteed that you can make an amount greater or
  equal. You have to minimise that value, though.
comments: >
  Notice that you receive the list of coins/bills you have, and you can only
  use each coin once.
