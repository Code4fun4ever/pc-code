summary: >
    A k-tree is defined as an infinite tree where each node has exactly $k$
    children, and each edge has a weight. For a given node, the weights of
    all the edges connected to its children are: $1, 2, 3, \ldots, k$. Given
    three values: $n, k, d$, determine the total number of paths from the
    root that have a total weight of exactly $n$, and where at least one
    edge has a weight $\ge d$.
