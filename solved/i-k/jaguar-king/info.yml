summary: >
    You receive a certain permutation of the first $N$ positive integers
    (with $N$ a multiple of 4). Determine the minimum number of moves to
    transform the sequence $1, 2, 3, \ldots, N$ into the given permutation.
    Each move consists of swapping number 1 with any of the valid positions
    to swap, according to the following rules. Let $i$ be the position of
    the number 1 ($1 \leq i \leq N$).

    If $i % 4$ (where % represents the modulo operation) is 1, then it can
    be swapped with the number on position $i+1$, $i+3$, $i+4$ or $i-4$. If
    $i % 4$ is 2 or 3, then it can be swapped with the number on $i+1$,
    $i-1$, $i+4$ or $i-4$. Finally, if $i%4$ is 0, then it can be swapped
    with the numbers on $i-3$, $i-1$, $i+4$ or $i-4$.

    Notice that the version of this problem in LightOJ is more friendly, and
    you may get AC in that judge more easily, using a simpler heuristic. In
    UVa the constraints are harder to handle, so you may require to optimise
    better your program, and prepare the heuristic function more carefully.

    Think of pre-computing a reasonable estimate of steps to move a certain
    number from position $i$ to position $j$ for all $(i, j)$. This could be
    done with a simple BFS.
