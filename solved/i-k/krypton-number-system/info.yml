summary: >
    Consider a numeric system in base $b$ (with $b \leq 6$), in which no
    number has the same digit in two consecutive positions, and no number
    begins with a zero. Each number also receives a "score" equal to the sum
    of squares of the differences between consecutive digits. For a possibly
    large score $s$, find out the total amount of numbers in that numeric
    system that have a score $s$.
