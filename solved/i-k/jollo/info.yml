    A game is played by two people, each one with three cards (all cards
    have a distinct numeric value). On each round a card is played by both
    players, and the winner of the round is the one with the highest card
    (those cards are then discarded). The first player to win two out of the
    three rounds wins the game.

    Given the values of the three cards of one player, and two of the cards
    for the second player, determine the lowest possible card that the
    second player needs to guarantee a win, even if he plays in the worst
    way possible.
