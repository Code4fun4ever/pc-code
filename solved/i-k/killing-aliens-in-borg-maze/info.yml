summary: >
  There's a maze with a number of aliens in certain cells. You start at a
  certain position, and from there you have to reach all aliens in the maze
  with the minimum number of steps. However, you can also take advantage of
  a special feature: on your starting cell, and on every cell where an alien
  stands, you can replicate any number of times you want, and your
  replicates can move through the maze independently.
