summary: >
    24 chess knights are places on a board of size $5 \times 5$, 12 black
    and 12 white. One cell remains empty, and any piece can move into it, as
    long as it moves as a regular knight. Given an arbitrary configuration
    of the board, find the minimum number of moves to transform it into one
    target configuration.
