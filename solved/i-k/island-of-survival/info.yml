summary: >
  You are left on an island with a number of tigers and deer. Each day two
  creatures from the island (including you) selected at random are faced
  with each other. A tiger kills any opponent (including other tigers), and
  if you face a deer, you con choose to either kill it or not. Determine the
  probability that at some point in the future you will be completely safe
  (no tigers are left on the island).
