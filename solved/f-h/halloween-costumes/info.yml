summary: >
  Someone wants to attend a series of parties wearing costumes. He may wear
  several costumes at the same time, one on top of another. When he arrives
  at another party, he may need to change into another costume, and for that
  he may put a new costume on top, or remove the most recent costume, to
  show something else underneath.

  Given the number of parties to attend, and the order of the costumes he
  has to wear, determine the minimum number of times that he has to put on a
  costume.
