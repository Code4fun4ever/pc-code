summary: >
  A number of political parties calls strikes (a.k.a. hartals) periodically.
  Given the number of days to study, and the hartal periodicity of each
  political party, calculate the number of days in the range where a strike
  is called.  Note: Strikes on Fridays and Saturdays are ignored.
