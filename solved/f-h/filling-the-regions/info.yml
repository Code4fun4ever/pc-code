summary: >
    A grid of characters is presented. An uppercase letter is used to
    represent a single region, and all the cells in the grid with the same
    letter are part of the same region. Regions are continuous, meaning that
    if it has more than one cell, then every cell has neighbour cells from
    the same region. Fill all the regions completely with their respective
    letters. Some regions can be inside of others, but they need to
    disappear because the external regions have precedence.
