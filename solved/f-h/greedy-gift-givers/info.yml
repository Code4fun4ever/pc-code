summary: >
  A group of people give gifts to each other. Each person has a certain
  amount of money, and decides to split it evenly to buy gifts for a list of
  friends. At the end of the transactions, each person is left with a net
  amount of money received or spent (could be a positive or negative value).
  Given the description of the groups of people, their initial money and
  their friends, determine the net values for everyone in the end.
comments: >
  There is apparently a small inconsistency in the problem statement.  Any
  money not given is kept and is **not** part of a person's "net worth".
