summary: >
    Four players take positions over a sequence of 7 cells. Each player
    moves to an adjacent square each step, and no more than one player can
    be over a single cell at any time. You are asked to count the number of
    ways in which the players can reach the Nth step (for a very large $N$).
comments: >
    Although it may not be directly obvious from the problem statement, the
    number of each player is not important. In other words, the total number
    of states is only $\binom{7}{4}$.
