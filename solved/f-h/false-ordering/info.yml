  Let $F(x)$ be the number of divisors of $x$. An arbitrary order is defined
  for a list of integers, such that for any pair $x, y$, $x$ comes before
  $y$ if: $F(x) is less than $F(y)$, or if $F(x)$ is equal to $F(y)$ and $x>y$.

  Order the list of the first $N$ positive integers, and then answer to a
  series of queries that ask for the $n$th term in the sorted list.
