summary: >
  Three robots are placed in a maze, where there are three "exit" cells.
  When you issue a movement, all robots move at the same time, and only move
  to an adjacent cell if it's going to be empty the next turn. Find the
  minimum number of movements until all three robots are placed on the three
  exits.
