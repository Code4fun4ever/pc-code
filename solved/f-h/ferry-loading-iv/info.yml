summary: >
  A ferry is located on the left bank of a river. There are a number of cars
  on both sides of the river, waiting to cross on top of the ferry. Given
  the lengths of the cars (and the ferry), determine the minimum number of
  times that the ferry has to cross the river to take care of all the cars.
