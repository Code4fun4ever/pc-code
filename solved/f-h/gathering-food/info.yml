      A maze is given with letters from the english alphabet on some cells,
      always starting with A, and increasing in order. You start on cell
      'A', and have to visit all other letters in order, without stepping on
      cells that would result in the wrong order of visitations. Determine
      the minimum number of steps to do this.
