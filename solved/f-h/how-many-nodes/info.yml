summary: >
  Given a number $n$, representing a number of different binary trees, find
  out how many nodes it's necessary to build $n$ distinct binary trees.
comments: >
  This is the inverse of the problem "Hoe many trees?" (UVa ID 10303).
  Notice that the answer is expected to be the highest number of nodes to
  produce a maximum of $n$ trees, so this means the answer for $n=1$ is 1
  and not zero.
