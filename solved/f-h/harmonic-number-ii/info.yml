  Given $n$ (upper bound $2^{31}$), calculate the sum $n/1 + n/2 + \dots +
  n/n$, using integer division.
comments: >
  This problem has little to do with harmonic numbers, and more with integer
  division and its implication in a series like the one given.

  Think about the value $n/(n/i)$ for each $i$ (using integer division
  only), and how that can help you calculate the answer quickly.
