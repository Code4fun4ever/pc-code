summary: >
    A set of $n$ football teams have matches against each other. Each team
    has two kits: one for home games, and one for visitor games. All teams play
    two matches against all other teams, exactly one mhome and one visitor
    match against each team. Two teams can't play with the same kit color,
    so if that situation happens, the visiting team usus its home kit. Given
    the colors of the kits for all $n$ teams, count how many times a team
    uses its home and visitor kits.
