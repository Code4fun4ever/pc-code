summary: >
    An analog clock with two hands (for hours and minutes) only moves them
    by discrete steps, with 60 steps in the full circle. Given a number
    between 0 and 180, representing a certain angle in degrees, report if
    there is any moment of the day where the minimum angle between the two
    hands of this day is exactly the amount given.
