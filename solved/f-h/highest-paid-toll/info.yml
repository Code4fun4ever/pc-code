summary: >
  You receive a large weighted graph of nodes and one-way roads, a source
  node, a destination node, and a cost "limit". Find the largest cost of a
  single edge that belongs to any path between the source and destination
  paths, where the cost of the entire path doesn't exceed the given limit.
