summary: >
    A number of ghosts and humans are placed on a square grid. The ghosts
    want to scare all humans, but one ghost can scare only one human. The
    time it takes to scare someone is equal to the distance to reach the
    human's square and go back to the starting cell, plus two. Determine the
    minimum amount of time necessary to scare all humans.
