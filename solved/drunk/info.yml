summary: >
  A list of pairs (a, b) of names of drinks is given, where each pair (a, b)
  denotes that $a$ must be drunk before $b$.  Determine if it's possible to
  drink all items listed given the constraints.
comments: >
  This is equivalent to finding if there is a cycle in a directed graph or
  not, which can be solved by applying a standard topological sorting
  algorithm.

  Just be aware that the nodes in the graph are represented by strings (the
  names of the drinks), so use a data structure that allows you to quickly
  and easily identify the nodes from their corresponding strings.
