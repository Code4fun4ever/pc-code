    There's an undirected graph that represents a number of places that you
    can visit. Imagine that going from one place to another (provided
    there's an edge between the two nodes) takes 1 unit of distance.
    Determine the total number of places that you can reach from node 1,
    after walking a positive, *even* number of units of distance.
