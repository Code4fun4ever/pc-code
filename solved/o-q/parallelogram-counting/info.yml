summary: >
  Count the number of parallelograms formed by a set of lattice points.
comments: >
  An useful observation is that a parallelogram is a figure formed by 4 points
  where the sum of x-coordinates of one pair of points is equal to the sum
  of x-coordinates of the other two points, and the same happens with the
  y-coordinates.
