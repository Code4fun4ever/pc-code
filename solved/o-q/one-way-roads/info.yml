summary: >
  A number $n$ of cities are connected by $n$ roads, formerly
  bi-directional. However, the roads became one-way roads, and now the
  cities may or may not be connected. Redirecting each road has a certain
  cost; find the minimum cost to redirect some roads until all $n$ cities
  are connected.
