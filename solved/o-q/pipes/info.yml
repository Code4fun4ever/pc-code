summary: >
    A system of pipes can be seen as a rectangular grid, where each cell can
    have between 0 and 4 lines, going out from the center of the cell, into
    any of the 4 cardinal directions. The "pipes" in each cell can be
    rotated (so NE can become ES, for example). Given the description of
    lines in each cell, determine if it's possible to rotate them until no
    boundary is left unstable (that is, at each boundary either zero or two
    lines meet).
