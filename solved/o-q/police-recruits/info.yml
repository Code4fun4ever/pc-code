    A sequence of integers is given, representing a series of events. A -1
    indicates a crime occuring, a positive number indicates a number of
    police officers recruited. A crime is handled if there is at least one
    police officer available, and when one officer gets busy, it will remain
    that way. Determine the total number of crimes that are left unhandled.
