summary: >
  There are two properties that a string can have and will be tested in this
  problem: a string can be a palindrome (in the standard meaning), or a
  mirrored string, whose definition is based on a character table that tells
  you what is the "mirrored" version of each characters, if it exists.

  Test a string and tell if it's just a palindrome, just a mirrored string,
  both or neither.
