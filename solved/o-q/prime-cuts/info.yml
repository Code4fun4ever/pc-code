  Given two integers $N, C$, calculate the list of prime numbers up to $N$
  (consider 1 as a prime for this problem), and then take $2C$ or $2C - 1$
  numbers from the center of the list, and print them.

  In case you're confused with the problem statement:

  * Consider 1 as a prime number.
  * Taking a certain amount (either $2C$ or $2C - 1$) of numbers from the
    *center* of the list means that the center of the sub-list you take
    coincides with the center of the original list. For example, taking 5
    numbers from the list $1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19$ means taking $3,
    5, 7, 11, 13$.
