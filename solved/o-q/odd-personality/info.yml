summary: >
    Given an undirected graph, where there is at most one edge between any
    pair of nodes, determine the number of nodes from which you can start an
    odd tour. An odd tour is defined as a path that starts and ends on the
    same node, visiting an odd number of edges, such that each edge can be
    visited at most once.
