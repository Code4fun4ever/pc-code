summary: >
    Given a permutation of the first $n$ positive integers, given as $a[1],
    a[2], \ldots, a[n]$, find a valid way to sort the list by choosing pairs
    of indices $i,j$ and swapping $a[i], a[j]$, such that $j-i+1$ is always
    a prime number, and the total number of swaps doesn't exceed $5n$.
