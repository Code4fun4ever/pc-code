summary: >
  Given a number $N$ of doors (big integer), a sequence of operations is
  performed as follows: initially, all doors are closed, then all multiples
  of 1 are opened, then all multiples of 2 are changed (from open to
  closed), then all multiples of 3 are changed, and so on. Find the highest
  door that is opened in the end.

  The answer has to be a number with an odd number of divisors. This happens
  only if the number is a perfect square, so you can use a big integer
  square root routine, or code your own based on binary search.
