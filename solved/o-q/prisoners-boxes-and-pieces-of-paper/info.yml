summary: >
    A number $n$ of prisoners (with $n$ being an even number) play a game,
    where once a day $n$ boxes are placed, each with a piece of paper inside
    with the name of one prisoner, and every name appears exactly once. Each
    prisoner is given the opportunity to open $n/2$ boxes. The pieces of
    paper are assigned randomly to the boxes, and the prisoners have the
    opportunity to formulate a strategy before proceeding, but once they do,
    they cannot communicate between them, or modify the boxes or pieces of
    paper in any way. Assuming they formulate an optimal strategy, determine
    the probability of every prisoner finding their name, and the expected
    number of days they will have to play the game until that happens.

    Correctly" by Peter Winkler.
