summary: >
    A number of colored circles and rectangles are described. Then a list of
    points is given. For each point, print its color, which could be: white
    if it's not covered by any geometric shape, black if it falls right on
    the border of any shape, or the average of the colors of all shapes that
    cover that point, otherwise.
