summary: >
    A request for proposal describes a number of requirements (presented as
    strings). A proposal is a list of items to satisfy some or all
    requirements, and has a price. Proposals are valued according to the
    ratio of requirements met against the total number of requirements, and
    then according to their prices. Given a RFP, and a list of proposals,
    identify the best proposal.
comments: >
    Considering the input specifications, is it really necessary to even
    store the requirements?

    You may assume that all strings have at least one non-whitespace char.
