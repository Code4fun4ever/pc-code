  A 3-letter string is to be converted into another 3-letter string, where
  at each step any of the letters can be swapped with the next or previous
  alphabetical character (wrapping at both ends). Find the minimum number of
  steps to make the transformation. However, a number of forbidden strings
  are also specified, which cannot be used as any of the intermediate steps.
