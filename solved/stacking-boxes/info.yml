summary: >
  A tuple of $n$ integers is said to be "nested" inside another if there
  exists a permutation of the $n$ values in one of the tuples such that
  every integer is smaller than the same position from the other tuple.
  Given $k$ tuples, determine the largest number of tuples that can be
  nested in chain, and print the numbers of one possible order of the
  nesting.
