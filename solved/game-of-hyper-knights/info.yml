summary: >
  Consider an infinite chess board, where the upper left corner is (0, 0)
  and the cell to its right is (0, 1). A Hyper Knight is a piece that moves
  around that board, and has 6 ways to move: (1, -2), (-1, -2), (-2, -1),
  (-2, 1), (-1, -3) and (-3, -1).

  A game consists of an arbitrary number of hyper knights placed on a board
  (more than one piece can be in a given cell). Two players take turns to
  move one piece. The winner is the last person who can make a valid move.
  Given a configuration of the board, determine the winner.
