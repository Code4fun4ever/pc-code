  The problem description is short on details about what a whitespace is,
  where can it occur, and how many consecutive whitespaces can be expected.

  Make sure to consider any non-printable characters as whitespace, and try
  to be very strict in printing all whitespace characters as-is (don't add
  any newlines or whitespaces if they are not in the input). Keep a large
  buffer to store words (size 1024 works fine).
