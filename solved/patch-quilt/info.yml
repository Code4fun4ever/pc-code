summary: >
  A certain number of names are hidden inside a rectangle of letters. To
  find a name, you can start at any position, and move to any adjacent
  position for the next letter (including diagonals and even not moving). If
  a name is found, it's guaranteed that there will only be one way to find
  it. Given a rectangle of letters, and a list of names, determine the
  location of each name if it's found, or report that it's not found
  otherwise.
