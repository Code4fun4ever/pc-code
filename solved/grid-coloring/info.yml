summary: >
    Each cell in a grid of size $M \times N$ has to be painted with one of
    $K$ colors. However, some cells can be "blocked", which means that they
    can't be painted at all, and there's an additional restriction: any pair
    of cells that are adjacent vertically have to be painted in different
    colors. Determine the total number of ways in which the grid can be
    painted.
