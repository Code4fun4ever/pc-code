summary: >
  The area of a rectangle $a$ is given, and a number $b$. Find the number of
  ways in which the rectangle can be formed, where the shortest side is at
  least $b$, and the two sides can't be equal (can't be a square).
comments: >
  Finding the actual list of all divisors of $a$ is very useful here. Then
  checking the number of ways to form the carpet with the given constraints
  is easy.
