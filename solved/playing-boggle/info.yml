    A grid of $4 \times 4$ letters is given and a dictionary of words. Your
    task is to determine if the words are found inside the grid, given that
    you can use a sequence of adjacent (horizontally, vertically or
    diagonally) letters, but each letter in the grid can be used at most
    once per word. If found, a word has a certain score, based on its
    length. Find the total score for all the words in the dictionary.
