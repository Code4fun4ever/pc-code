summary: >
  Pseudo-random numbers will be generated by using the formula: $R(n + 1) =
  (Z \cdot R(n) + I) % M$ where $R(i)$ denotes the i'th random number, and
  $R(1)=L$ is called the *seed*. This process eventually produces a cycle
  because the numbers start repeating after some number of steps. Given the
  values of $Z, I, M, L$, determine the length of the cycle.
