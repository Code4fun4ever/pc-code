summary: >
  A string with 3 consecutive vowels, or 5 consecutive consonants is called
  "bad". Conversely, a "good" string is a string that is not "bad". You are
  given a string which can contain "wildcard" characters, which are
  positions where either a vowel or a consonant can be placed. Report if the
  string is definitely good, or definitely bad, or could be both.
