summary: >
    A connected, weighted, undirected graph with $N$ vertices and $M$ edges
    ($N \le 50000$, $M \le 10^5$) is given. The "cost" of a path inside the
    graph is defined as the weight of the heaviest edge along that path.
    Afterwards a number of queries is given, where each query describes two
    random vertices. For each query, answer with the lowest cost possible
    for any path between the two vertices.
