summary: >
  Hansel and Gretel play a game with a cake. The cake is rectangular and cut
  into a "grid" of $m \times n$ squares. One of those squares is the "bad"
  square, which neither of the two players want to eat. The game is played
  by taking turns and making a cut through any horizontal or vertical line
  in the grid. The player then keeps the piece without the bad square and
  passes the other piece to the rival. The loser is the player who is left
  with only one square, the one with the bad piece.

  Given the size of the cake, and the player who starts the game, determine
  who will be the winner.

  This is an impartial game that can be considered equivalent to a nim-game
  with four piles. Think about the position of the "bad" square, and what
  would be considered the "piles" in this game.
