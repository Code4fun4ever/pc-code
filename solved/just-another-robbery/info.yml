summary: >
  A series of bank robberies is being planned. There are $N$ banks, each
  with a certain amount of money, and with an associated probability of
  getting caught if it's robbed. Assuming that the probabilities are all
  independent, and a given probability $P$, find out the maximum amount of
  money that can be robbed, without exceeding a total probability of getting
  caught of $P$.
