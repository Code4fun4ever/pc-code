summary: >
  A number is considered lucky if its digits are only 4 or 7. A number is
  very lucky if it's either a lucky number, or it's the product of any
  positive number of lucky numbers. Given a possibly large range, find the
  number of very lucky numbers in that range.
comments: >
  The hardest part is pre-calculating all very lucky numbers up to
  $10^{12}$; do it in a way that is not too slow, and not too memory-hungry.
  Then just use binary search to find the answers.
