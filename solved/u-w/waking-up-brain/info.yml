summary: >
  A graph of 26 nodes (represented by the letters $A, B, C, \dots$) has some
  "sleeping" nodes with connections between them. Three of those sleeping
  nodes are awakened all at once. Now, every sleeping node that is directly
  connected to at least three awake nodes becomes awake in one year.
  Determine the number of years required for all sleeping nodes to awake, or
  if it will never happen.
comments: >
  Note that there's no guarantee that all of the sleeping nodes are
  connected between them. There could be more sleeping nodes that are
  accounted for in the rest of the input, so don't make assumptions.
