summary: >
  Find the maximum number of nodes required in a Trie (prefix tree) to store
  strings formed by $K$ different symbols (each symbol used at most once).

  The recurrence relation is: $f(n+1)=(n+1) \times (f(n) + 1)$. Since the
  answer has to be presented modulo $10^4$, notice that every 10000 numbers
  the answer is zero again. Actually, every 500 numbers it's zero again, so
  that reduces the run time even more.
