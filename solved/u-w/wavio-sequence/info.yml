summary: >
  A "Wavio" sequence is a sequence of integers of odd length, where the
  first half of the numbers (including the middle number) is strictly
  increasing and the second half is strictly decreasing. Given a list of
  numbers, determine the length of the longest subsequence that forms a
  valid Wavio.
