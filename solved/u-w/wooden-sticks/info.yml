summary: >
    A machine has to process a set of $n$ sticks, represented as 2-integer
    tuples. A machine can handle a sequence of sticks in one pass, as long
    as for any pair of tuples $(l_i, w_i), (l_j, w_j)$ with $i<j$, it holds
    that $l_i \le l_j$ and $w_i \le w_j$. Determine the minimum number of
    passes the machine has to do to handle all sticks, if you can arrange
    the sticks in any order.
