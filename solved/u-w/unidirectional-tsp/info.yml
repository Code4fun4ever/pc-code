summary: >
  Given a grid of numbers, find the path from the first to the last column
  with minimum cost, traveling only to the right to an adjacent cell
  (horizontal or in diagonal). The first row is considered adjacent to the
  bottom row (i.e. it "wraps around"). Print the minimum cost and the
  lexicographically lowest path the corresponds to it.
