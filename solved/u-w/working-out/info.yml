summary: >
    Given a rectangular grid filled with integers of size $n \times m$, find
    the sum of values of two paths, one from $(1, 1)$ to $(n, m)$, and one
    from $(n, 1)$ to $(1, m)$, such that they are disjoint except for only
    one cell $(i, j)$, the paths only move right or down, or only move right or
    up, and the sum is maximised. The value of cell $(i, j)$ must not be
    part of the sum.
