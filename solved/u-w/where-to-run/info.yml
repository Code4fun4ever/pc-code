summary: >
    Trying to escape from the police in a city with $n$ junctions and $m$
    bi-directional roads between the junctions, you plan to remain fugitive
    as much time as possible. To do it, you start on the first junction, and
    at each junction you can choose move to any adjacent junction as long as
    it is still possible to visit all remaining unvisited junctions from it,
    or you can choose to stay 5 minutes in the current junction (if there's
    at least one junction you can move to). You can choose any option with
    equal probability (staying or moving to each valid neighbour).

    You can't move anymore and are caught by the police when you no longer
    have valid neighbours to run to (all visited junctions are immediately
    occupied by police). Given the graph of the city, where the weights of
    the edges represent the time required to travel along a path, determine
    the expected amount of time for the police to catch you.
