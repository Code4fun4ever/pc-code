summary: >
  Consider the recursive definition of a function $A(n)$ such that
  $A(n+1)=A(n) \div 2$ if $A(n)$ is even and $A(n+1)=3A(n)+1$ if $A(n)$ is
  odd; this function produces a sequence of numbers that converge into one.
  Given two integers that denote the bounderies of a sequence of consecutive
  positive integers, determine the number $n$ in that sequence for which
  $A(n)$ produces the longest sequence.
comments: >
  This problem bears some resemblance to other problems like *The 3n+1
  problem* (UVa 100) and *The Collatz Sequence* (UVa 694), but read the
  problem statement carefully and think about how to handle all the details
  that are not explicitly mentioned. For example, the input of each test
  case is formed by two integers, but it's not guaranteed that they come in
  order.

  Note that, like in the other similar problems, any kind of memoization is
  unnecessary and it will probably just make things more complicated.
