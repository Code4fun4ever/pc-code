  Given a town modeled as an m*n grid of cells, and a list of people living
  in each cell (multiple people can live at each cell), find one cell where
  the cost of moving everyong to that place is minimum.

  Think about the problem in 1 dimension (see for example Vito's Family, UVa
  ID 10041) and apply the solution to 2D.

  Notice the constraints of the problem, and the maximum number of people
  that could be described. This means that a naive sorting of an array might
  be too slow. Instead, you can implement your own algorithm to find the
  median. A useful algorithm for this is known as quickselect, and is very
  similar to a standard quicksort. Make sure to randomise the selection of
  the pivot, and make all your data points unique (even if the input values
  for u, v, and w are equal), to avoid a worst case complexity.
