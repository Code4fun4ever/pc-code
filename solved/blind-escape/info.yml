summary: >
  A hero wants to get out of a maze. He knows the maze perfectly, but he's
  blind. He doesn't know his current position inside the maze, and he wants
  to get out applying a sequence of moves that guarantees that he will get
  out, no matter where he is. It's important to note that a move consists of
  him moving in one of the basic 4 directions, until he either meets a wall,
  or is outside the maze. What is the shortest sequence that guarantees his
  escape?
