summary: >
  A list of houses and their neighbours will be presented to you. Find out
  the places with the least amount of neighbours and print the list sorted.
comments: >
  The core of the problem is reading the input correctly. Other than that,
  the problem statement doesn't even make much sense (X being neighbour of Y
  doesn't imply Y being neighbour of X?).
