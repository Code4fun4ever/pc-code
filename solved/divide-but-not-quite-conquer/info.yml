summary: >
  You receive two integers $n, m$. Determine if it's possible to form a
  sequence of integers $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_k$ such that $s_1=n$, $s_k=1$ and
  $s_{i+1} = s_i \div m$ and $s_{i+1} > s_i$ for all $1 \leq i < k$. If it
  is, print the resulting sequence.
comments: >
  Something that is not explictly stated and is important here is that $k$
  must be at least 2, otherwise the sequence would not be valid.
