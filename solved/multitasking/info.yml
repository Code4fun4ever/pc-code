  A schedule is formed by one-time and recurrent tasks. A one-time task has
  a beginning and ending time; a repetitive task has, in addition, a period
  of time to start over again. Given a schedule formed by both types of
  tasks, determine if there is any conflict in the tasks; that is, if there
  is any pair of tasks that intersect.
