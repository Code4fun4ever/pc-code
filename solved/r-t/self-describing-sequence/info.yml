summary: >
  Golomb's sequence is the only nondecreasing sequence such that for each
  positive integer $k$, $f(k)$ describes the number of times that $k$ shows
  up in the sequence.

  Given the value of $k$, find the value $f(k)$.
comments: >
  A straightforward approach simply takes advantage of the fact that the
  sequence "describes" itself, in the sense that its terms describe the
  places where the value of the sequence changes. Using this observation and
  a little memoization, it's possible to pre-calculate all required values
  and use binary search to find the answers.

  Another approach would be applying a recursive formula that produces the
  terms of the sequence, but deducing this formula is not trivial.
