summary: >
  A crop field is described as a $1 \times N$ matrix of characters, where
  each cell represents either a fertile or an infertile piece of the field.
  Scarecrows can be placed on any position, and they protect the cell they
  are on, and their immediate neighbours. Given an arbitrary field,
  determine the minimum number of scarecrows necessary to protect all
  fertile pieces of the field.
