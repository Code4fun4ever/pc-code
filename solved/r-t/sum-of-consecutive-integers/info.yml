  First, notice that this problem asks for the number of ways that N can be
  expressed as a sum of *positive* integers. Now, this problem can be solved
  as follows. Given the prime factorization of N:

    $p_1^e_1 * p_2^e_2 * ... * p_k^e_k$

  where $p_1$ is 2 (the first prime) and $e_i \geq 0$, the number of ways to
  express N is $(1+e_2)*(1+e_3)*...*(1+e_k)$.
