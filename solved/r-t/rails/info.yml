summary: >
  Given a sequence of the first $N$ positive integers, determine if it's
  possible to manipulate them to produce a given arbitrary permutation,
  using only a stack.
comments: >
  If you look closely at the sample output, you'll notice a contradiction
  which is that the problem description says to always print a blank line
  after a block of input, but the sample output doesn't include a blank line
  after the last test case. Follo the advice from the problem description.
