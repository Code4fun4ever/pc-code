summary: >
  Given an integer $N$ (greater than 9), if you remove its last digit, you
  get $M$. If you know the value of $N-M$, you have to find out the possible
  value(s) of $N$.
comments: >
  Try writing a small auxiliary program that shows you the value of $N-M$
  for a few cases (N = 1, 2, 3, ...). You will find a pattern that can help
  you with the algorithm.
