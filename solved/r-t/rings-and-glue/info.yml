summary: >
  A number of "rings" (circumferences) are described by the coordinates of
  their centres and their radii. Find the size of the largest subset of
  overlapping rings. Two rings overlap if their perimeters touch.
comments: >
  Visit all pairs of rings and if they overlap, unite their sets. If the
  answer is 1, make sure to print "... contains 1 ring" and "rings" in all
  other cases (including zero).  From testing, it seems like no test case
  from the input has rings that only touch in one point, or rings that touch
  in infinite points (identical rings).
