    A city is modeled as a 2D plane. Taxis have to make trips between
    locations, such that each location is a lattice point and the time it
    takes to travel between two points is equal to the manhattan distance,
    in minutes. Given a list of all the trips that need to be covered,
    determine the minimum amount of taxis required to satisfy them. Each
    taxi has to be able to reach the starting point of a trip at least one
    minute in advance in order to take it.
