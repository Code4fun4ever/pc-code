  Consider a board of size $M \times N$ (the maximum value for $M$ is 8) and
  two types of "blocks". One of size $2 \times 3$ and the other $3 \times
  2$. In addition, the board may have some "broken" cells which are cells
  where nothing can be placed on top of them. Determine the maximum number
  of blocks that can be placed inside the board.
