summary: >
  The traffic map of a city is represented by a graph, where each vertex has
  a "busyness" value associated to it. Whenever someone goes from a vertex
  $i$ to a vertex $j$, the city gets the amount $(B_j - B_i)^3$ (where $B_i$
  is the busyness value). Find the minimum value that the city can obtain
  when someone travels between an arbitrary pair of nodes.
comments: >
  The input in UVa's judge has strange bytes at the end, so make sure your
  reading routine is robust and can handle that.
