    An election is prepared, such that a number of male and female
    candidates are given. Each vote either is for electing a male and
    rejecting a female, or for electing a female and rejecting a male. A
    voter is satisfied if both his/her wishes are honored. Given the list of
    votes, determine the maximum number of voters who will be satisfied.
