summary: >
  A monocyle is built such that its circular wheel is divided in five
  different sections, each with a different color. Someone is riding the
  monocycle over a rectangular grid, where moving to an adjacent square
  makes the wheel move exactly one fifth of a circumference, so the color
  that makes contact with the ground changes. Moving one square, or rotating
  90 degrees take exactly one second. Find the minimum time to go from a
  starting point to a destination inside the grid, with the constraint that
  on both points the color making contact with the floor has to be the same.
