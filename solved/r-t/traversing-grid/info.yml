    Consider a rectangular board with a certain number of rows and columns.
    A traveler starts from the upper-left corner, facing right, and it moves
    until it reaches the end of the board, or his next step puts him in a
    cell he has already visited. In that case, he stops if the whole board
    is covered, or turns right and continues otherwise. Given the dimensions
    of the board, determine the direction the traveler faces when he stops.
