summary: >
    Trees are identified by a couple of integers, denoting their *type* and
    *height*. A group of trees can be formed by consecutive trees all of
    different types. The price of a group is equal to the height of the
    tallest tree in that group. Given a list of trees, determine the least
    cost possible for all the trees.
