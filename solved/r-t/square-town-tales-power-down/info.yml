summary: >
    A square grid of positive integers representing population is given, and
    a list of additional integers, representing capacities of power plants.
    For each power plant, determine the largest possible square area that can be
    covered by the plant, and the population it covers, maximising first the
    area and second the population coverage.

    Perhaps the main difficulty in this problem is simply decoding the
    confusing problem statement. The description is very strange, certain
    elements of the problem are obscured by the wording, the input
    specification is inconsistent with the samples while some things are
    left to be assumed from the samples, etc. Absolutely delicious.
