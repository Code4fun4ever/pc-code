summary: >
    A rectangular grid is filled with three types of cells: Rock, Paper or
    Scissor (just like in the game). In one time step adjacent cells fight
    each other with the same rules as the RPS game, and the winner takes its
    corresponding cells. Given an initial configuration of the grid, and a
    number of steps, determine the state of the grid after that number of
    steps.
