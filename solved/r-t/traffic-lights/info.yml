summary: >
  A traffic light is said to have a cycle time T, which means that it will
  spend T - 5 seconds green, then 5 seconds orange and then T seconds red
  before repeating the pattern.  The cycle times of at least 2 lights are
  given, and it is assumed that at time 0 all lights have just turned green.
  The lowest time when all lights are green again, from the moment one of
  them becomes orange for the first time, has to be printed. If it doesn't
  happen in 5 hours, then print a message to that effect.

  Watch out for the strange format of the input. It might be possible that
  the solution is _exactly_ 5 hours.
