summary: >
  You have a list of the first $n$ positive integers (maximum 22 or 50,
  depending on the judge), and an integer $m$ in the range $[1:n]$ which
  indicates the starting point. You have to produce a sequence of numbers
  that alternate between smaller, bigger, smaller, bigger, and so on. If $m$
  is the lowest number (1), then the second number second number has to be
  the closest as possible to it, while still maintaining the zig-zag in the
  sequence.

  Count the number of ways in which such a sequence can be chosen.
comments: >
  Notice that the wording of the problem statement is a little ambiguous
  ("Even in this case.."). The numbers can be chosen arbitrarily as long as
  they alternate between smaller and bigger. The only special case is if
  $m=1$, and in that case the second number has to be 3 (if $N>2$), and then
  2, and then it continues normally.
