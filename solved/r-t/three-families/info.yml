summary: >
    Three families need to do a certain job, and they normally do the same
    effort to complete it. One time, one of the three families don't
    participate, so the other two families do the job by themselves,
    spending $x$ and $y$ hours working. The third family pays $z$ dollars to
    the other families for covering. How much money should go to the first
    family (the one who worked $x$ hours)?
