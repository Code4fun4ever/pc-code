    Given $n$ integers, representing lengths of songs and two more values,
    $t, m$, the maximum capacity of a disc and the number of discs, find out
    the maximum number of songs that can ba recorded in the $m$ discs. The
    songs have to be processed in a single pass and recorded on the discs in
    order; that is, song $s_i$ can be recorded on disc $d_i$ and song $s_j$
    on $d_j$ iif $s_j \ge s_i \Rightarrow d_j \ge d_j$.
