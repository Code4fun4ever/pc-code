summary: >
    A tiling system proposed by Sebastien Truchet consists of using
    different tile patterns to fill a 2D plane. Two of these patterns are
    used to fill a rectangle with integer lengths. Given the description of
    the tiles used to fill the rectangle, and a group of lattice points,
    determine the total area that would be filled by a "paint bucket" tool,
    starting on those coordinates.
