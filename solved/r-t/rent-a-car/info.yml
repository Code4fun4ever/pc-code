summary: >
    A car rental business has to satisfy a number of requests. A certain
    number of requests for cars are received on a number of days. To satisfy
    a request, you must provide on that day either a brand new car, or a
    used car that has been serviced. You know about a number of car dealers,
    and car servicing places; for each dealer you know the amount of cars
    and their prices, and from the servicing locals you know their prices
    and how long it takes them to service a car.

    Find the minimum cost to satisfy all requests.
