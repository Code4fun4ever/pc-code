summary: >
    Two teams play a number of games until one of them wins a fixed amount
    of games. There are no ties, and the probability of the first team
    winning a single game is $p$. The problem statement describes a
    recursive method for calculating the probability $P$ for the first team
    winning the total match, given two parameters $i, j$ that represents the
    amount of games that the two teams need to win the match.
    Given the values of $p, i, j$, determine the value of $P$, and the total
    number of times that the function has to be applied recursively.

    You might think that the core of this problem is calculating $P$, but
    that may not be the case. Perhaps the most interesting element in this
    problem is calculating the number of recursive calls, taking into
    account that the result can be a big integer, and there is a time and
    memory limit.  Also, there is one set of input that is considered
    invalid, and you need to print "-1.00000", and 0 as the number of calls
    in that case.
