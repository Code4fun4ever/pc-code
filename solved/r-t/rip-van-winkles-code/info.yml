summary: >
  You start with an array of 250 thousand integers, all initially set to
  zero. You have to implement four types of operations: add the sequence of
  integers $1, 2, \dots$ from left to right to a given range of positions,
  add the sequence $1, 2, \dots$ from right to left to a range, set all
  positions in a range to a certain value, and finally query the sum of a
  given range.
