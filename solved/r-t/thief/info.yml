summary: >
    A certain number of items are to be stolen. Each different kind of item
    has a price, a requirement (minimum number of items of this kind that
    have to be stolen) and a weight. Given the information for $n$ types of
    items, and a weight $W$, you have to select items such that the
    requeriments are satisfied, the items don't weight more than $W$, and
    the price of any extra items (not in the requirements) is maximized.
