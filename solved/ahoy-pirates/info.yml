  You receive a possibly large array of boolean values (maximum $10^3 \cdot
  2^{10}$). You have to implement four types of operations over the array:

  * Set a range of values (set to 1).
  * Clear a range of values (set to 0).
  * Flip a range of values.
  * Query how many values are set to 1 in a range.
