summary: >
  Four wheels with the digits 0..9 are placed side by side, so they form a
  four-digit number. By pressing buttons, you can move any wheel to one side
  or the other. Find the minimum number of presses to make the wheels show a
  certain number, considering that there are some "forbidden" configurations
  which the wheels should not show.
