summary: >
    Consider a tree where each node has a signed numeric value. A
    $K$-anti-ancestral subset of nodes is a subset of nodes from the tree,
    with at least 1 and at most $K$ nodes, such that no node is ancestor of
    another in the subset. Given the tree, and the value $K$, find the
    maximum sum of nodes possible from all $K$-anti-ancestral subsets.
