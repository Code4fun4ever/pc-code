summary: >
  You receive a list of $N$ integers. You need to calculate the summation of
  this list of numbers, but every time you add two numbers $a$ and $b$, it
  has a cost $a+b$. The total cost of adding the list of numbers is the sum
  of costs of all intermediate additions required to complete the task.
  Determine the minimum possible cost to add the numbers.
