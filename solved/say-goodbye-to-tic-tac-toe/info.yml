summary: >
  A new game originally based on Tic-Tac-Toe is created. It is played in a
  grid of size $1 \times N$. Two players take turns to place one of two
  symbols in one unocuppied cell of the grid. The two symbols are 'X' and
  'O'. However, the same symbol can't be placed in two adjacent squares. The
  winner is the player who places the last symbol. Given an arbitrary
  configuration of the game, determine if the player who goes first wins or
  not, when both players play optimally.
