summary: >
  You receive a list of size $n$ with some permutation of the first $n$
  positive integers. This list represents the order of $n$ events. Then you
  receive a number of additional lists of size $n$ with other permutations
  of the same $n$ integers. The numbers in these lists also represent an
  ordering of the same events. Compare the first list with each additional
  list given, and find the length of the longest subsequence of events in
  the correct relative order between the two lists.
