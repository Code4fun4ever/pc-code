summary: >
    You are given two matrices of integers, representing the amount of two
    materials (uranium and radium) found in a rectangular area. You have to
    collect those materials by placing either horizontal or vertical
    conveyor belts. Horizontal belts move materials towards the west, and
    vertical ones towards the north. However, all materials have to be
    transported by moving them only in one direction (they can't be moved in
    a path with turns). Determine the maximum amount of materials that can
    be gathered by choosing the optimum system of belts.
