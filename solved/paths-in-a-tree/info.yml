summary: >
  Given a tree with directed edges (which can point upward or downward),
  find the minimum number of paths that cover the complete graph, taking
  into account that:
  * Paths can only have edges that go in the opposite direction than the
    edges of the original graph
  * Paths can visit any vertex or edge more than once
  * Multiple paths can have edges and vertices in common.
