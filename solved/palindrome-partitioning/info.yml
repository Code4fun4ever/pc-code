summary: >
  Given a string of length up to 1000, find the minimum number of substrings
  found in any palindrome partition of the string. A palindrome partition is
  a partition of the string where all substrings are palindromes.
comments: >
  Think about first determining if each substring is a palindrome or not.
  This requires visiting pairs of positions (i, j), so it's a $O(n^2)$
  process. Then with that, find another $O(n^2)$ process to calculate the
  answer.
