summary: >
    Someone is going to fish from a number of lakes. Fishing on each lake,
    and going from one lake to the next takes time. You know the expected
    amount of fish that can be gathered on each lake, although it decreases
    with time fror each lake. A plan is to be generated to optimise the
    number of fish that can be caught.
