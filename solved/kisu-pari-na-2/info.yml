summary: >
    Given an undirected graph without cycles, where the distance of each
    edge is $1$, determine the minimum distance required to visit $K$
    distinct vertices.
comments: >
    Think about the diameter of a single connected component inside the
    graph (let's call it $D$). What would be the toll to pay for any $K \leq
    D + 1$? How about any additional unit above $D + 1$?
