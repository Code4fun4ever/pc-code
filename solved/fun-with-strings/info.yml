summary: >
  Consider strings formed from the alphabet { a, b }. A sequence of strings
  can be originated from any initial string, where the next string in the
  sequence is obtained by replacing all occurrences of 'a' with 'b', and all
  'b' with 'ab'.

  Now you are given 5 integers $N, X, M, Y, K$ that indicate that the $N$th
  term of the sequence is a string of length $X$, while the $M$th term has
  length $Y$. Determine the length of the $K$th term, if possible.
