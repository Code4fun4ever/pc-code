  A list of "lucky numbers" is given. For each lucky number, a bamboo of a
  certain length has to be chosen, such that the "score" of the bamboo is
  greater or equal to the lucky number.  The score of a bamboo of length $x$
  is the amount of integers smaller than $x$ that are relatively prime to
  $x$. Determine the minimum possible sum of lengths from the bamboos for
  the set of lucky numbers.
