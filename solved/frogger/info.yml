summary: >
  You get a series of $n$ points in a 2D plane. These points form a graph,
  in which you can assume there is an edge between all pairs of points.  The
  first point from the input is the origin, and the second point is the
  destination. You have to find the minimax value from the edges that belong
  to a path from the origin to the destination.
