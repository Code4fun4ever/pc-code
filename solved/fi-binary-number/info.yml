summary: >
  A Fi Binary Number is a binary number that doesn't contain two consecutive
  ones. The first such numbers are $1, 10, 100, 101, 1000, 1010, \dots$.
  Given an integer $n$ (maximum $10^9$), find the $n$th Fi Binary number.
comments: >
  Observe how many Fi Binary numbers of each length there are (how many
  numbers of length 1, of length 2, and so on). Can you notice anything
  interesting? Think about why they are called *Fi* Binary numbers. This
  relation is helpful to find the answer.
