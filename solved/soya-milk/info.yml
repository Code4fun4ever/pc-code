summary: >
    A carton of milk has the shape of a box. When tilted a certain angle
    (smaller than 90 degrees), milk pours over from the top, such that the
    level of the milk is always formed by the horizontal line that
    intersects the corner that is letting the milk out. Given the dimensions
    of the carton, and the angle of inclination, determine the volume of
    milk left inside the box of milk.
