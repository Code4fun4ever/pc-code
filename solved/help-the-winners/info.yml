    A group of $n$ dresses is to be matched with $n$ pairs of shoes. Each
    single match between one dress and one pair of shoes produces one of
    three possible results: 0 (no match), 1 (normal match) or 2 (super
    match).  Find the number of total matchings among the two groups of
    objects such that either all pairings are of type 1, or at least one of
    the pairings is of type 2.
