summary: >
  Consider a square where each side has length $a$. Now, from each corner of
  the square, draw an arc of radius $a$ that lies inside the square. This
  produces a figure where three types of areas are recognisable inside the
  square. Given the value of $a$, calculate the total area covered by each
  of the three types of areas.
