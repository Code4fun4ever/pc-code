summary: >
  Given $n$ (up to 18) coins with distinct values, find if it's possible to
  make $K$ money. $K$ is large ($1 \leq K \leq 10^9$). Every coin can be
  used a maximum of 2 times.

  There are many ways to arrive to the answer, but given the tight time
  limit, the core of the problem is partitioning the set of coins to reduce
  the number of computations. One possible way to do it is splitting the set
  in two halfs. From each half, calculate all the combinations that are
  possible using each coin 0, 1 and 2 times. Then, for each value from one
  half, try to locate its complement in the other half through binary search
  or hashing.
