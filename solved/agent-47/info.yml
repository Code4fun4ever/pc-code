summary: >
  A number of targets have to be shot. You start with a weapon that does a
  damage of one to all targets. You receive the health level of all targets,
  and a matrix that represent how much damage can be made to each target
  with the weapons you can take from them (only after you have completely
  finished a target). Determine the minimum number of shots required to
  finish all targets.
