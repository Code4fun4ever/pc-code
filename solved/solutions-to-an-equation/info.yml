summary: >
    Given seven integers $A, B, C, x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2$, determine the total
    number of integer solutions $(x, y)$ for the equation $Ax + By + C = 0$,
    such that $x_1 \le x \leq x_2$ and $y_1 \le y \le y_2$.

    This problem is *very* tricky. Not only it requires deducing how to
    apply Euclid's extended algorithm to solve the general problem, which is
    challenging in itself, but it also requires extreme care with every
    little detail in the calculations. Be careful with the data types, the
    signs of every number at each intermediate step, special cases (where A
    or B are zero, or both), etc.
