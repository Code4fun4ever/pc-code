summary: >
  A ferry transports cars across a river, moving them from either bank to
  the opposite side. The cars are attended in a first-come-first-served
  fashion.  Knowing the arriving time of the cars, the capacity of the ferry
  and the time it takes to move across the river, report the times when each
  car reaches its destination.
