summary: >
  Consider a rectangular board of size $M \times N$ where the minimum
  between $M$ and $N$ is at most 8. There are also 6 types of tiles: two
  tiles with 2 blocks each (each block of size $1 \times 1$) and in the
  shape of vertical and horizontal bars, and four tiles with 3 blocks each,
  representing the four rotations of an L-shaped tile.

  In addition, the board may contain a number of "broken" cells; positions
  where nothing can be place on top of them. Find the number of ways in
  which you can fill the board using the tiles.
