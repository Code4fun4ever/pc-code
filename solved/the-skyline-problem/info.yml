summary: >
  A set of rectangles, all of them with their sides parallel to the axes,
  and with their bottoms on the X axis, are described by the triples $(L, H,
  R)$, where $L$ is the X-coordinate of the left side, $H$ is the height,
  and $R$ the X-coordinate of the right side.

  Given a number of rectangles, print the description of the outline from
  all the rectangles as a sequence of elements $(X_1, H_1, X_2, H_2, \dots,
  H_{k-1}, X_k)$.
comments: >
  Given the constraints, it is possible to solve the problem using an array
  of heights and updating it with each rectangle description (basically a
  brute force approach), but a more efficient solution is possible using a
  sweep-line algorithm.
