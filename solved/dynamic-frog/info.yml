summary: >
    A frog wants to cross a river two times (go to the opposite bank and
    back) by jumping on a series of rocks placed in a line. Some rocks are
    big and the frog can jump freely on them any number of times he wants,
    but other rocks are small and can only be used once, and then they
    disappear. Determine the minimum distance possible for the largest jump
    that the frog has to make to cross.
