  Given $n$, calculate $H_n$ (the nth term of the harmonic series).
comments: >
  There are at least two methods to solve this. The first one simply
  involves using memoization, but as it's not possible to reserve memory for
  $10^8$ *double* variables, you need to store just a certain fraction of
  those numbers, and then compute the answers from the closest memo'ized
  value you have.

  The other approach involves using calculations from number theory. You can
  look up an interesting approximation for $H_n$ from Wikipedia, involving
  the natural logarithm of $n$, Euler's constant ($\gamma$) and Bernoulli's
  numbers.
