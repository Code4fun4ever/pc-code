  First, notice that this problem asks for the number of ways that N can be
  expressed as a sum of *positive* integers. Now, this problem can be solved as
  follows. Given the prime factorization of N:

    p_1^e1 * p_2^e2 * ... * p_k^ek

  where p_1 is 2 (the first prime) and ei >= 0, the number of ways to express
  N is (1+e2)*(1+e3)*...*(1+ek).
