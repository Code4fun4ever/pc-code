summary: >
  Consider a weighted, directed graph with $N$ nodes and edges. A set of $S$
  nodes (15 maximum) are shops. Find the shortest path from node 0 to node
  $N-1$, visiting the maximum possible number of shops.
comments: >
  Think about perhaps creating a simplified graph (with a maximum of S + 2
  nodes) before calculating the final answer.
