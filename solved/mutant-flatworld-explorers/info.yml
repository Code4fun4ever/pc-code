  A series of robots are placed in a rectangular field, where they can move
  according to the four basic orientations (north, east, west, south). For
  this, they can receive three types of commands: move left, move right, or
  move forward once cell. In addition, a robot may go outside the field, in
  which case it gets lost, but it leaves a scent, so no other robot after it
  can get out of the field from the same cell.

  Given the descriptions of the field, the initial configurations of the
  robots and their instructions, determine the last position and orientation
  of every robot.
