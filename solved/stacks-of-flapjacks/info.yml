summary: >
  A stack of flapjacks, each with a different size, is given. You have to
  report any sequence of steps that sorts the stack, leaving the largest
  pancake on the bottom of the stack. The only possible move is to choose a
  space between the pancakes, and flip all the pancakes on top of that
  point.
comments: >
  Think about how it can be solved by solving its sub-problems: how to move
  the largest pancake to the bottom, then how to move the second largest
  pancake to the second position, etc.
