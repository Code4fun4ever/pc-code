  A number of villages are connected by roads. A postman has to visit every
  village, going through every road at least once, and finishing his trip on
  his starting village. Every time he travels through a road, he has to pay
  one unit of money. There is also a certain value $w_i$ associated to every
  village, that denotes that whenever node $i$ is visited for the first time
  as the $k$th distinct village visited, the postman receives or pays money
  according to the expression $w_i - k$.  Find the maximum amount of money
  the postman can win (or minimum he would lose), and print one valid route
  to accomplish this.

  After some analysis, it should be clear that the order in which the
  villages are visited is irrelevant. You can calculate the profit
  before you even read the edges, and then just build the Eulerian cycle
  with the given graph (it's guaranteed to exist).

  Notice that it's possible that more than one edge connect two given nodes,
  and there could be edges from one node to itself.
