  A number of villages are connected by roads. A postman has to visit every
  village, going through every road at least once, and finishing his trip on
  his starting village. Every time he travels through a road, he has to pay
  one unit of money. There is also a certain value $w_i$ associated to every
  village, that denotes that whenever node $i$ is visited for the first time
  as the $k$th distinct village visited, the postman receives or pays money
  according to the expression $w_i - k$.  Find the maximum amount of money
  the postman can win (or minimum he would lose), and print one valid route
  to accomplish this.
