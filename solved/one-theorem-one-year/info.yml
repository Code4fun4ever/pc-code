summary: >
  Given two values $K, P$, calculate the sum of $\Phi(X)$ for all distinct
  $X$, where $\Phi$ is Euler's Totient function and $X$ is a product of $K$
  numbers chosen from the first $P$ primes.
comments: >
  The core of the problem consists of calculating the sums of all terms
  $p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2} \cdot \dots \cdot p_P^{e_P}$ such that $K=e_1 +
  e_2 + \dots + e_P$. There is an elegant D.P. solution for this with
  complexity $O(K^2)$.

  (Side note: I wonder where the title of this problem comes from... what
  theorem? what year?)
