  Let N(a) be the number of ways a race can finish, if the race has a horses.
  Let M(a, b) be the number of ways a race can finish with a horses, if b
  horses end up in first place. Then, N(a) = \sum_{i=1}^{a}{M(a,i)}.

  And M(a, b) can be calculated using binomial coefficients:
  M(a, b) = aCb*N(a-b), where aCb is "a choose b".
