summary: >
  The Collatz sequence is defined as a sequence of numbers where the k'th
  term $C(k)$ is equal to $C(k-1) \div 2$ if $k-1$ is even or $3C(k-1) + 1$
  otherwise, until one is reached. Find the number of elements that can be
  computed from the sequence, starting with a value $A$, and without
  exceeding a limit $L$.
