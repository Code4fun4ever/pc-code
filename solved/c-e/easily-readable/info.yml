  Two words can be considered "similar" if they have the same set of
  characters and they start and end with the same letters (the letters
  between them can be rearranged freely).

  Given a dictionary of words and a series of sentences, find out for each
  sentence, how many different sentences can be formed using words from the
  dictionary that are similar to the words in the original sentence.
