summary: >
  Decode a string, by replacing each character by the character two
  positions to its left in a standard US keyboard.
comments: >
  This problem was created with a complete disregard for the fact that there
  are many types of keyboards. Consider this as the entries in the keyboard:

  ~~~~
  qwertyuiop[]
  asdfghjkl;'
  zxcvbnm,.
  ~~~~

  In addition, note how the input can have uppercase or lowercase letters.
  The output must always use lowercase letters.
