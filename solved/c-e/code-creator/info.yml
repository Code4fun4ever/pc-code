summary: >
  You receive $N$ lines of text. Write a C program that generates as output
  the given lines of text, following the format given in the problem
  statement.
comments: >
  Note that is a couple of strange things in the sample input: the use of
  non-standard "quotes" characters, and the presence of empty lines, which
  are not accounted for in the specification of the input. Process only
  regular ASCII quotes, and completely omit empty lines.
