summary: >
  A sequence of integers $n_1, n_2, \dots, n_k$ is called *divisible* by $K$
  if there is a valid combination of signs +/- that you can put between the
  numbers of the sequence, such that the resulting expression is a number
  divisible by $K$.

  Given a sequence of $N$ numbers and a number $K$ (100 maximum), find if
  the sequence is divisible by $K$.
