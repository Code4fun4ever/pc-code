comments:
  A very nice problem to get familiar with the basic of parsing techniques.

  There is a way to solve this problem using a simple stack, but it requires
  some careful manipulations to simulate the right behaviour of a proper
  parser.

  In any case, if you put the effort to build a recursive descent parser,
  this problem has enough interesting elements to ensure that your solution
  will be something useful in the future (maybe in real life problems):
  abstract syntax trees, post-order traversals, a simple domain-specific
  language, operators with different priorities, etc.
