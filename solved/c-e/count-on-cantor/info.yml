  Find the *ith* term of the Centor's series of rational numbers (1/1, 1/2,
  2/1, 3/1, 2/2, ...).
comments: >
  Given the relatively lax constraints of the problem, there are multiple
  ways to solve it. In order of efficiency: simple simulation with
  memoization, binary search, or math calculations.

  The more efficient solutions require some interesting formulations based
  on discrete mathematics. Think about triangular numbers.
