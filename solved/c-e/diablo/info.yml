summary: >
  You have a large list of integers and you have to perform two operations
  over the list: append an integer to the list, or get the ith element from
  the list.
comments: >
  To solve it with a segment tree, think of an array of size $n+q$, and
  in the tree store the size (number of nodes) of each subtree. This means
  that, initially, every leaf in the tree that corresponds to index $i$ of
  the array would have a value of 1 if $i < n$ or 0 otherwise. Then
  implement *query* and *update* operations such that every query turns the
  value of the leaf to zero, and all its ancestors are updated accordingly,
  and in an update, the leaf turns into 1, and the ancestors are updated.
