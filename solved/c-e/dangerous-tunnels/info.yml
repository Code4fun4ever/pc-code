    A directed, weighted graph, with a source and a sink are given. A number
    $k$ denotes a certain number of paths to consider inside the graph, such
    that for any given node (excep the source and sink) no more than one
    path visits it. The cost of a path is defined as the cost of the
    heaviest edge in that path. Determine the minimum cost from any group of
    $k$ paths from the source to the sink.
