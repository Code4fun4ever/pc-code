summary: >
  You have a pack of 54 cards (the 52 standard cards and two jokers). Given
  four integers $C, D, H, S$, find the expected number of cards you have to
  draw until you have at least $C$ clubs, $D$ diamonds, $H$ hearts and $S$
  spades. The jokers can be used for any suit, but the selection has to be
  made before drawing the next card, trying to minimize the number of cards
  to draw.
