summary: >
    Given a directed graph, where each vertex has a cost, determine the
    minimum cost and the number of different ways in which a smallest subset
    of vertices can be selected, such that the entire graph can be visited
    through tours from the selected subset of nodes---a tour being a path
    that starts and ends on the same vertex.
