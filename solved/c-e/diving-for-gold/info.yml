summary: >
    A group of treasures can be picked by diving and taking them to the
    surface, one at a time. Each treasure has a value and is located at a
    ceretain depth. The time required to take each treasure is proportional
    to its depth. You have only an air bottle with a fixed capacity for a
    certain amount of time under water. Determine the maximum value for the
    treasures that can be taken, and print the ordered sequence of
    treasures.
