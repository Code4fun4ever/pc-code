summary: >
  A boolean matrix (filled with ones and zeroes) is given. It is said to
  have the _parity property_ if all the rows and columns have an even number
  of ones. Report if the matrix has the property, or can be turned into one
  that has it by flipping just one cell inside the matrix, or if it's
  corrupt (it doesn't have the property and can't be fixed with one flip).
