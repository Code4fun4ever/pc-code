summary: >
  A number of invitations are distributed among $N$ people as follows:
  person number 1 hands all invitations to one of his friends, each person
  in turn receives a number of invitations, keeps one for himself, and then
  delivers them all to one of his friends, until somebody can't deliver any
  more invitations. If that person still has invitations, he hands them back
  to the person he received them from. When someone receives a number of
  invitations back from someone, he then looks for another friend with no
  invitations and continues the process.

  In the end, every one of the $N$ people receives one invitation. Determine
  the number of times that someone received invitations, and the number of
  pairs of people who are definitely not friends.
