summary: >
  There is a group of cities that must be visited by a group of commandos;
  there is an unlimited number of commandos and they all take one unit of
  time to move from city to city. They start at a certain city (the base),
  and they all have to meet up at a destination in the end. Find the minimum
  time required for the commandos to visit all the cities and meet up in the
  allocated city afterwards.
