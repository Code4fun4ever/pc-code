summary: >
    Given a real number $R$ with at most 6 characters in its decimal
    representation, and an integer exponent $n$, find the exact value of
    $R^n$.
comments: >
    The problem statement doesn't mention what to do if a result doesn't
    have any significant digits after the decimal point (whether to include
    the point or not), but it seems that there are no such cases.
