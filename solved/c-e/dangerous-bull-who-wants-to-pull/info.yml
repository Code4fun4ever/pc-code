summary: >
  You are given a list of pairs of points in a 2D grid. A pair of points
  means that you may connect those locations with a line.  You are also
  given the coordinates of one special point, where a bull is resting.
  Determine the minimum perimeter of a convex polygon (using the given
  points) that encloses the location of the bull. No pair of points given is
  collinear with the bull, and the result has to be multiplied by two.
