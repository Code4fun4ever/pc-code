summary: >
  A new currency is defined as the composition of two different integer
  values $V$ and $Y$. The total value of a new "coin" $(X, Y)$ (called
  e-modulus) is $\sqrt{X^2 + Y^2}$. The sum of two coins $(X_1, Y_1)$,
  $(X_2, Y_2)$ is defined as $(X_1 + X_2, Y_1 + Y_2)$.

  Given a number of coins, and a target value $S$, find the minimum number
  of coins necessary to make a total value of $S$.
