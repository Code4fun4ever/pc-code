summary: >
  A trip is to be planned. The road is linear and there are N campsites
  along the way. A number K of stops have to be done to rest and spend the
  night at any campsite. Given the distances between all points, plan the
  trip minimasing the amount of walking that has to be done in any
  particular day.

  Note that, although it's important to assume that you can walk as much
  possible each day when calculating the minimised cost, when printing the
  result, the number of lines has to be exactly K+1, and that means that
  some days it might be necessary to *not* walk as much as possible.
