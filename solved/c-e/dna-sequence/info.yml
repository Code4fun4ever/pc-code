  Given a list of strings formed from the alphabet { 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' },
  find the lexicographically lowest, shortest string that contains all given
  strings as substrings.

  This is an instance of a classic problem known as the "Shortest Common
  Substring". It can be solved by relating it to the Traveling Salesman
  Problem. For more details on this approach, read section 18.9 of *The
  Algorithm Design Manual* by Skiena. Notice, however, that the strategy
  described there assumes that no string is a substring of another string
  initially, so it's important to handle such situations properly.
