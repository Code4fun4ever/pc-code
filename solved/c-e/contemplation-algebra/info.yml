summary: >
    Given the values of $a + b$, $ab$ and $n$, calculate $a^n + b^n$.
comments: >
    LightOJ's version of the problem statement is much clearer, indicating
    how the values of $a$ and $b$ don't have to be real numbers, and that
    the answer has to be modulo $2^{64}$, so use unsigned 64-bit integers
    there. UVa's version (the original problem statement from Manzoor) is...
    well, a typical problem statement from Manzoor. Use *signed* 64-bit
    integers there.
