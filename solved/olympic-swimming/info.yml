summary: >
  A swimming pool of integer length $L$ is divided in a number $K$ of lanes.
  Each lane can contain a number of hurdles, which are obstacles places in
  the middle of two discrete points in the lane. A race can be setup inside
  the swimming pool, from point $A$ to point $B4, if in the range $(A, B)$
  there is the same amount of hurdles in all lanes.

  Given the description of a pool, with its lanes and hurdles, find the
  longest race that could be setup in a given swimming pool.
