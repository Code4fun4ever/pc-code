summary: >
  Given a number $N$, find the number of occurrences of each decimal digit
  in the sequence of integers $1, 2, \dots, N$.
comments: >
  Given the low limit for $N$, this problem can be solved by simple
  simulation. A more efficient solution, based on dynamic programming is
  also possible; see *Digits Count* (UVa 12241) for a similar problem with
  larger limits.
