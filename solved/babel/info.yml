summary: >
  A group of words and languages are associated, such that a language can
  have many words, but each word can only be associated with exactly two
  languages.

  You receive a "starting" language and an "ending" language. Find the
  length of the shortest sequence of words that go from the starting to the
  ending language.

  Two words can be adjacent in a sequence if they have one language in
  common, and you can't use two words that start with the same letter
  consecutively. The length of the sequence is the sum of lengths of all the
  words used.
