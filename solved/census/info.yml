summary: >
  Given a 2D grid of integers, you have to perform two types of actions:
  change the value in a given cell of the grid, or query the maximum and
  minimum values of a rectangle inside the grid.

  This problem has one of the most confusing and lacking descriptions you
  could find. It's a shame, because the problem behind it is really
  interesting, but it's butchered by one of the sloppiest jobs made by a
  problem setter.

  These are some things that have been revealed in the forums by the
  community:

  * The grid is not of size $N \times N$ but $N \times M$. The first line of
    the input has the values of $N$ and $M$.
  * When in doubt, believe what the sample implicitly states, not the
    description. For example, the queries do start with a character 'q' or
    'c'.
  * All integers seem to fit in a 32bit signed integer.
  * Apparently it's possible that the queries provide indices that go
    outside the bounderies of the grid. Make sure you handle this correctly.
  * The "change" in population is simply setting the cell to a new value,
    not adding or subtracting from it.
  * The indices are in the following ranges:
    $1 \leq x \leq N$, $1 \leq y \leq M$.
