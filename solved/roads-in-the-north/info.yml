  In a weighted tree, find the pair of nodes that are the most distant.
comments: >
  Not only is the input provided in a very awkard way, you have to consider
  that there can be cases with zero cities ---you have to print zero as the
  answer in that case.

  One algorithm that works to find the graph diameter is starting a DFS from
  an arbitrary node $v$ to find a node $w$ that is as distant as possible
  from $v$. The pair $(v, w)$ is not guaranteed to provide the diameter, but
  if you start a second DFS from $w$, then the new pair you form *is*
  guaranteed to provide the longest distance between any pair of nodes; a
  formal proof for this is not very difficult.
