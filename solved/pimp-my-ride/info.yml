  Given $n$ tasks to complete (maximum 14), you receive a matrix $n \times
  n$ of integers, such that each position $(i, i)$ represents the cost of
  completing task $i$ and each position $(i, j)$ for $i \neq j$ represent
  the extra cost of completing task $i$ after having completed task $j$.
  Determine the minimum cost for completing all tasks.
