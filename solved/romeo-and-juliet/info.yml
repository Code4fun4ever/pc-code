summary: >
    Two points $N, M$ are on opposite sides of a line segment $AB$. The
    point $A$ also lies on the line $NM$. Given the coordinates of the
    points $A, B$, and the angles $BNA$ and $BMA$, determine the maximum
    length possible for the line $NM$.

    Did you notice the discrepancy between what the problem statement
    describes and the figure? The figure is actually wrong (not really
    "partial" as the caption states). Trust the text when it says that
    points $N, A, M$ lie on the same straight line.
