summary: >
    Two sets of pairs of integers are given. Each pair represents two
    positions on two separate, parallel lines such that they are linked by a
    string. No strings touch each other among pairs of the same set, but it
    may be possible that pairs from different sets do touch or intersect.
    Determine the total number of distinct pairs that touch.
