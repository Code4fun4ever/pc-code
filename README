This is my repository of solved problems from online judges such as UVa,
LightOJ, SPOJ, etc.

You can consider all of this in the public domain. You can do whatever you
want with this; my recommendation is to always try to solve the problems for
yourself as much as possible, and only use the code of others as a last
resort, and only to guide you.

For some educational discussion on a few interesting problems, you can see
my programming contests blog, at <http://lbv-pc.blogspot.com/>.

Have fun!
